  <p>I do a lot of writing -- mainly for myself and for school, but occasionally for small audiences (i.e. friends and one captive boyfriend). I'm still relatively new to the practice, only having started about four years ago, but I take everything I write very seriously. Here are some of the few pieces that I'm willing to share.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Blog posts:</b> I keep a regular blog that I write in at least once a month. It can get very personal in nature and so I only share it with a handful of people. Below are some of the less personal, more interesting posts I've written.</p>
