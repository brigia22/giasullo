	 <p>Finally: a new thing to obsess about.</p>
   <p>December 2, 2020</p>

<div class="stuff">
  
  <p>Thanks or no thanks to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/NationalLampoon_201812" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> I was recently able to download a huge collection, possibly every published issue from the 70s to the 90s, of <i>National Lampoon.</i></p>

<p>The obsession with <i>National Lampoon</i> began more out of curiosity about one of the magazine's founders, Doug Kenney, because I randomly decided to watch <i>A Futile and Stupid Gesture</i> during one of those bored Netflix weekend nights. I don't remember how long ago I watched the movie but I loved it and it made me cry and I immediately decided that I needed to read the book that inspired it. I’m currently working on the book now and I think it’s pretty horribly written but interesting enough to keep me going anyway.</p>

<p>This is quickly becoming a crazy ramble but I think my interest in Doug Kenney stems from a larger overall interest in sad comedians, and especially sad comedians who really enjoy messing with people. When I was maybe ten or eleven my family and I watched <i>Man on the Moon</i> in which Jim Carrey portrays Andy Kaufman. I had absolutely no idea who Andy Kaufman was at the time but I was fascinated by the widespread frustration that he caused throughout his comedic career. I asked my dad if the events in the movie really happened and I pretty much couldn't believe him when he affirmed that he vaguely remembered seeing some of the pranks on live television and being confused by them.</p>

<p>I guess as a kid I didn’t have the wherewithal to pursue any meaningful research into Andy’s life, but as an adult I went back to that interest and read <i>Andy Kaufman: The Truth, Finally</i> by Bob Zmuda and Lynne Margulies. The book was not great and felt more to me like Bob Zmuda stroking himself for having known Andy better than anyone else, as he believed, and then pushing his weird conspiracy theory that Andy actually faked his own death and is still alive somewhere. Bob also seems more interested in bragging about his closeness with Jim Carrey during the filming of Man on the Moon and retelling vulgar and unintentionally sad stories of the two partying at the Playboy Mansion and pulling their own pranks on celebrities. Honestly, he should have just written the book completely about himself. I’ll have to find a better Andy Kaufman biography some other time.</p>

<p>Anyway, something about playing with the minds of general public really appeals to me, and I love vicariously living through comedians who excel at doing it. I guess Doug Kenney and the rest of the incredibly sharp editors of <i>National Lampoon</i> fit perfectly into my interests and so now I’m determined to read every single issue of the magazine. I most likely won’t get like eighty percent of the jokes because they are of a time and a lot of them explore political themes that I usually struggle to follow, but I’m hoping to embrace the jokes as a learning experience. Maybe I’ll actually remember some important history things and like figure out who was the thirty-eighth president of the United States or something. I’ve never been good with history unless it is somehow injected with comedy or fiction, so overall I think this will be a fulfilling experience.</p>
