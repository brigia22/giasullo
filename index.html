	 <p>About</p>
</div>

  <p>My name is Briana. I taught myself HTML when I was a kid and I recently decided to get back into it. I enjoy learning new coding languages but I am most comfortable with HTML, and so my plan is to continue experimenting until I can expand my knowledge into other languages.</p>
  <p>This 'About' page is inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> in that I intend to update it pretty frequently with information about things that I am currently doing or interested in.</p>
  <br>
  
  <p><b>New Project:</b> I recently decided to build a photo collection of snowmen. If you're wondering why... <a href="https://snowglobephl.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">best to just visit the collection!</a>&nbsp; &#9924;
    <br>Note: I'm currently in the process of migrating this tiny collection from Google's Blogger platform (which of course wasn't designed for archival collection management) into Omeka, where I hope to expand the collection and turn it into something a bit *more*.</p>
  <br>
  
	<p><b>Reading:</b> I'm currently part of a small book club that consists of me and some high school buddies. We virtually reconnected at the start of the pandemic and have since read several books together. Our most recent was <i>Into the Wild</i> which serendipitously resurfaced in the news last year. Not to give too much away, a good portion of the nonfiction story centers around an abandoned bus that for a long time resided in the Alaskan woods, and was <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/09/25/into-the-wild-bus-back-in-fairbanks/" target="_blank">recently airlifted to be preserved in a museum.</a> As far as the book goes, my friends and I were not crazy about some of the author's decisions, but nonetheless enjoyed learning about Chris McCandless and his somewhat mysterious journey into Alaska.</p>
    
    <p>The book club is now on a little break to allow its members to catch up on some personal reading goals. I was hoping get through some of the books taking up space on my bookshelf, but I instead caved and purchased yet another book to add to the pile. The book is <i>Was the Cat in the Hat Black? The Hidden Racism of Children's Literature, and the Need for Diverse Books</i> by Philip Nel. I was drawn to this book after watching a lecture by Philip Nel in which he addressed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/books/dr-seuss-books.html" target="_blank">recent decision by Dr. Seuss Enterprises</a> to stop publishing six of its books due to racist imagery within them. I was impressed by Nel's ability to articulate a lot of feelings around the situation that I've had but struggled to name, and I'm curious to learn more about how subtle racism in children's literature builds upon the structual racism that so many white people (myself included) hear about but often fail to recognize in daily life.</p>

  <p><b>Running:</b> The weather is quickly warming up and for me that means... more running! Running has long been my favorite exercise and method of detangling my brain at the end of a long workday. I tend to go into a semi-hibernation in the winter, opting for indoor yoga instead of forcing myself out into the cold. But I absolutely love warm-weather running and am looking forward to building my mileage back up to previous years. I completed a half-marathon back in 2017 but after that did not take running very seriously, and my standard 5-7 mile runs slowly turned into 2-4 mile runs. While I was never one to care about speed, I miss the longer runs and I hope to get back into that routine this spring and summer.</p>
