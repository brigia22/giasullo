	 <p>About</p>
</div>

  <p>My name is Briana. I taught myself HTML when I was a kid and I recently decided to get back into it. I enjoy learning new coding languages but I am most comfortable with HTML, and so my plan is to continue experimenting until I can expand my knowledge into other languages.</p>
  <p>This 'About' page is inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> in that I intend to update it pretty frequently with information about things that I am currently doing or interested in.</p>
  <br>
  
  <p><b>New Project:</b> I recently decided to build a photo collection of snowmen. If you're wondering why... <a href="https://snowglobephl.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">best to just visit the collection!</a>&nbsp; â›„
    <br>Note: I'm currently in the process of migrating this tiny collection from Google's Blogger platform (which of course wasn't designed for archival collection management) into Omeka, where I hope to expand the collection and turn it into something a bit *more*.</p>
  <br>
  
	<p><b>Reading:</b> Right now I am reading <i>Moby Dick</i> and I am honestly a little surprised at how much I'm enjoying it. Because the book is so prevalent in our culture, I assumed I knew pretty much everything I needed to know about the story at this point in my life. Guy gets really vindictive and hunts a whale and learns a tragic lesson about revenge or something, right? Well so far the book is actually pretty funny, and there is a lot more to the plot and characters than I imagined.</p>
  <p>A similar situation occurred to me in October, when I read Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i> with a small group of friends. We all knew the story of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster but I did not imagine that the story would be so complex and rambling. Spoiler alert: my friends and I were almost unanimous in our hatred for Dr. Frankenstein and his inability to take responsibility for his actions. I'm curious to know if this was the point of his character.</p>
  
  <p><b>Update:</b> I've gotten a little more than halfway through <i>Moby Dick</i> and interest is waning. I hear that things pick up in the third act so I am staying strong! I don't think the fact that I tend to read right before bed, when my eyes are already tired from reading for school and work all day, is helping my progress here but my eyes will just have to hold out a little longer.</p>
  <br>
  
  <p><b>Yoga:</b> My "yoga journey" if you will began sometime in 2015, when I desperately needed a new exercise to do inside when the weather is too inclement for me to run outside (my main exercise of choice). I started watching YouTube videos by <a href="https://yogawithadriene.com/" target="_blank">Yoga with Adriene</a> and was hooked pretty quickly. Adriene's videos are easy to follow and she maintains a casual and fun atmosphere, often cracking jokes and leaving her mistakes unedited. It's amazing how much stronger and more flexible I feel from practicing (on average) only about twice a week, for maybe twenty minutes each practice. With a potentially harsh winter ahead of us, I hope to master the Crow Pose by springtime.</p>
