	 <p>About</p>
</div>

<div class="stuff">
  <p>My name is Briana. I taught myself HTML when I was a kid and I recently decided to get back into it. I enjoy learning new coding languages but I am most comfortable with HTML, and so my plan is to continue experimenting until I can expand my knowledge into other languages.</p>
  <p>This 'About' page is inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> in that I intend to update it pretty frequently with information about things that I am currently doing or interested in.</p>
  <br>
  
  <p><b>New Project:</b> I recently decided to build a photo collection of snowmen. If you're wondering why... <a href="https://snowglobephl.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">best to just visit the collection!</a></p>
  <br>
  
	<p><b>Reading:</b> Right now I am reading <i>Moby Dick</i> and I am honestly a little surprised at how much I'm enjoying it. Because the book is so prevalent in our culture, I assumed I knew pretty much everything I needed to know about the story at this point in my life. Guy gets really vindictive and hunts a whale and learns a tragic lesson about revenge or something, right? Well so far the book is actually pretty funny, and there is a lot more to the plot and characters than I imagined.</p>
  <p>A similar situation occurred to me in October, when I read Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i> with a small group of friends. We all knew the story of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster but I did not imagine that the story would be so complex and rambling. Spoiler alert: my friends and I were almost unanimous in our hatred for Dr. Frankenstein and his inability to take responsibility for his actions. I'm curious to know if this was the point of his character.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Rereading:</b> Because I get impatient and read multiple books at once, I'm also rereading <i>The Broom of the System</i> by David Foster Wallace. Wallace is my favorite author and this is my favorite book of all time. I highly recommend anything this guy has written; I started with his last novel, <i>The Pale King</i>, but I've heard others recommend starting with his nonfiction essays if you've never read him before.</p>
  <br>
  
  <p><b>Yoga:</b> My "yoga journey" if you will began sometime in 2015, when I desperately needed a new exercise to do inside when the weather is too inclement for me to run outside (my main exercise of choice). I started watching YouTube videos by <a href="https://yogawithadriene.com/" target="_blank">Yoga with Adriene</a> and was hooked pretty quickly. Adriene's videos are easy to follow and she maintains a casual and fun atmosphere, often cracking jokes and leaving her mistakes unedited. It's amazing how much stronger and more flexible I feel from practicing (on average) only about twice a week, for maybe twenty minutes each practice. With a potentially harsh winter ahead of us, I hope to master the Crow Pose by springtime.</p>
  <br>
  
  <p><b>Cooking:</b> Pandemic downtime has led me to become a little more adventurous in my cooking habits. With school, work, interning, running, etc. I often felt like cooking was just a hassle that I didn't have time for. Now that I'm working from home, the time that would normally be used up by my bus commute (about forty-five minutes each way) is free for me to experiment with new recipes. My recent successes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Thanksgiving vegetarian stuffing and mashed potatoes</li>
    <li>Mushroom casserole</li>
    <li>Vegetarian chili</li>
    <li>Italian-style lentil soup</li>
    <li>White bean and kale soup</li>
    <li>Vegetarian chicken pot pie (subbed tempeh for chicken)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I am a vegetarian, hence the vegetarian recipes. My biggest failure so far was probably vegetable lasagna, which was more complicated than I anticipated and required a food processor, which I do not own. Lesson learned: Always read all of the recipe's instructions before starting!</p>
  <p>Many of the recipes I used can be found in Jennifer Perillo's cookbook, <i>Homemade with Love: Simple Scratch Cooking from In Jennie's Kitchen</i>. The book was given to me as a gift and I was told that it's no longer in print, but a quick Google search provides some options for purchasing it.</p>
